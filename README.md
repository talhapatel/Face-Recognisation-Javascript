# Face-Recognisation-Javascript
## First we need to train over model so it can identify that when we see in different picture 
## like here you have to add faces and put it in labeled_faces
## then you have to select any image in which that face is there
## tensorflow will detect and give grade in between 1-10
## if it is upto 6 then we can say sure it will correct label and draw square on face and write label name on top
